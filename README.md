## The concept

The brief was to celebrate Broadway's 25 years of cinema, and produce something sharable. The concept is to create an intereactive film documenting cinema through the individual years. Additional culture references such as music, video games, fashion and world events will be included to give context to the films and years. The film could be projected into the cafe bar and other areas of the Broadway cinema and online. The film will allow use of specific hastags so people can interact with the screen by texting and tweeting in their stories relating to what they see on the screen. In addition to the film, there will be a well-populated Twitter stream that people can follow.
