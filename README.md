## What is this?

## The concept

The brief was to celebrate Broadway's 25 years of cinema, and produce something sharable. The concept is to create an intereactive film documenting cinema through the individual years. Additional culture references such as music, video games, fashion and world events will be included to give context to the films and years. The film could be projected into the cafe bar and other areas of the Broadway cinema and online. The film will allow use of specific hastags so people can interact with the screen by texting and tweeting in their stories relating to what they see on the screen. In addition to the film, there will be a well-populated Twitter stream that people can follow.

## Web log

### 12:00 - 13:00: Ideas generation

Because we like to live life very much 'on the edge' we had not formed a clear plan for the day in advance of arrival. This being the case we took the first hour to brainstorm, mind map, and generally come up with something un-rubbish to work on. We thought of potential projects based around a few of the briefs before settling on a hack that would answer both the Esendex and Broadway briefs simultaneously.

### 13:00 - 14:00: Planning

We thought it would be a good idea to look at the tech requirements early on so signed up for an Esendex developer account and had a quick play with the API which was, as promised, very simple to use. Hoorary! I also drew a happy tree on a postit note as I wasn't really sure what I was meant to be doing. Greg installed things from 'the internet'.

### 14:00 - 15:00: Lunch

Healthy-yet-nice food was provided in the Mezzanine bar. There were chicken things, greek salad, samosas and olives. Also there were nice fruit flavoured drinks available in plastic cups.

### 15:00 - 16:00: Getting down to business

Greg installed more things from 'the internet'. Packages and so forth. Helen told me (Pete) to do something useful so I started documenting our process which you are now reading here. Greg is currently (15:24) making a auto-updating loop which will instanltly display any SMS sent to our virtual mobile number on screen. This is surprisingly exciting to everyone in the team.

Next we met with the Creative Guy from Broadway to see if they had any visual materials from the past which we could integrate into our project to provide context. He mentioned some old photos including one of Quentin Tarantino when he came to the Broadway for the unofficial UK premier of Pulp Fiction.
